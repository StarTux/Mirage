# Mirage

Display fake entities.  This plugin allows the data driven configuration of fake entities such as NPCs, floating blocks, or mobs, and realizes them via custom packets.  This plugin is under development.

## Documentation

Find the javadocs here: [startux.github.io/Mirage](https://startux.github.io/Mirage/).

## Development Status

Work is done to port the legacy NPC plugin but avoid its convoluted design.  Mobs and players should work for the most part, along with metadata and equipment.  Blocks lack an implementation.
